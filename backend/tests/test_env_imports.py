"""
Guards the pinned dependency set: importing sentence_transformers must not
crash. In a clean torch-only environment (the Docker image and Linux CI, which
install exactly backend/requirements.txt with no tensorflow) this passes.

Known caveat: on a host whose *global* env also has tensorflow installed, the
TF/torch native combination segfaults during this import (returncode 139). That
is local-env pollution, not a defect in the shipped deps — run from a fresh
venv created off requirements.txt, or `pip uninstall tensorflow`.
