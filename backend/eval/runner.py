"""
eval/runner.py

Runs a full benchmark against a model and writes results to the database.

For each test case:
  1. Build a per-case in-memory vector store from the reference document.
  2. Generate a grounded response (LLM sees the reference document).
  3. Score the response with the NLI detector against the reference.
  4. Write the result (incl. a binary predicted_label) to run_results.

At the end: aggregate stats -> complete_run, and — when the benchmark carries
gold labels (RAGTruth) — detector-vs-human metrics -> save_run_metrics.

Runs synchronously in a FastAPI background task; progress is polled via
GET /runs/{run_id}. LLM provider keys come from the server environment only.
